The EIGA project has been temporarily suspended due to continued difficulties and complications in the design process and as a result a lack of progress towards creating an actual GUI.
This does not mean that I will not work on this project again; I may pick it up again at some later point when I've figured out a sufficient design that doesn't lead into problems.
Instead, I will be creating a minimalistic GUI for my own use that does not aim to have the same flexibility or extendability (except in the sense of adding to or rewriting the code itself, of course).
The name of this minimalistic GUI project will be "MinGUI", and I will put everything for said project in a folder named as such within the EIGA directory.
